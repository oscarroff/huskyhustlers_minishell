# Minishell
Minishell project for Hive, Helsinki
Initial work by [venyywijaya] (https://github.com/venyywijaya) and [oscarroff] (https://github.com/oscarroff)
Full build by [cubiterjupiter] (https://github.com/cubicajupiter) and [oscarroff] (https://github.com/oscarroff)

## Under Construction
To try out the (mostly) complete parsing section of the program, checkout the tommie_working branch. You can run it in regular mode, or see a debug readout of how the parsing is performing using the flags '-d' for debug and '-e' to see how environmental variables are being handled.
E.g. `make && ./minishell -d -e`
